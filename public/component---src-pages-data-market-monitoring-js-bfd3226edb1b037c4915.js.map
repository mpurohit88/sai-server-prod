It\n            involves analysis and study of the business competitors and various\n            verticals of the competitor market, such as, product development,\n            product launch and marketing, product pricing, events, and other\n            such factors that boost the business. Data landscaping offers a\n            clearer idea of the position of the competitors in the market and\n            the personal business position relative to the competitions. <br />\n            The advanced data science landscape makes sure that the growth\n            opportunities of the business increases than their competitors. The\n            traditional methods of data analysis, such as SWOT, are not enough\n            anymore. For example, the SWOT analysis puts a business into a\n            defensive position. It tries to cover its threats and weakness while\n            maintaining its strength. This technique can be improved according\n            to the need of an organization by actively looking for prospects and\n            concentrating on refining the strengths.\n            <br />\n            With the help of market monitoring businesses can change their\n            demands and growth in the market. Data monitoring allows an\n            organization to know the overall movement of their competitors\n            especially product prices and their consumer backgrounds. With this\n            information, the organizations can change their prices, their\n            quality of products, and customer satisfaction process to gain and\n            retain new customers. Data market monitoring has become an important\n            part of modern day business processes. It prevents the loss of value\n            of an organization and helps them stay ahead of the competition.{\" \"}\n            <br />\n            The data market monitoring provides:\n            <br />\n            • Improved business responsiveness\n            <br />\n            • Relevant and timely information about competitors\n            <br />\n            • Better knowledge of probable threats and opportunities in the\n            market\n            <br />\n            Subscribe to data market monitoring service today.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div\n        className=\"row\"\n        style={{ padding: \"0\", background: \"white\", marginTop: \"0\" }}\n      >\n        <ul>\n          <li>Total Available Market (TAM)</li>\n          <li>Potential Addressable Market (PAM)</li>\n          <li>Market by Application</li>\n          <li>Export Data (by HS Code)</li>\n          <li>Import Data (by HS Code)</li>\n          <li>Market by specific region or country (as per request)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n","import React from \"react\"\n\nimport DataMarketMonitoring from \"../components/Solutions/DataMarketMonitoring\"\nimport SEO from \"../components/Base/SEO\"\nimport InnerPageBanner from \"../components/Shared/InnerPageBanner\"\nimport Layout from \"../components/Base/Layout\"\n\nexport default function () {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <SEO title={\"sheer analytics\"} />\n      <InnerPageBanner headingText={\"Data Market Monitoring\"} linkText={\"Data Market Monitoring\"} />\n      <DataMarketMonitoring />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/consultingBG-2c649d5cf2ea81c53f77b6d5132aeed0.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
