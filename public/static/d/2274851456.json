The SEO and content rely completely on each other. Though they work on opposite processes, it is important to understand that the SEO and content cannot be separated.

Now, in the recent years, this process has become complicated as Google now prefers <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing \">HIGH-QUALITY CONTENT</a>. </strong>If the website does not have a high-quality content the rank would fall.

The content marketing is holistic and broad whereas the SEO is full of technical work and is narrow.

Biopolymers refer to the polymers synthesized from living organisms and some of the biopolymer examples include, lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, peptides, DNA, RNA and polysaccharides such as cellulose, glycogen, and starch. Among the various end-use applications of biopolymers such as agriculture and horticulture; packaging and food services; automotive and consumer goods, packaging and food services generate the highest revenue wherein biopolymer packaging gains high popularity for wrapping premium and organic foods. In this application area, biopolymers are used as biodegradable packaging materials for fresh food, meat trays, juice bottles, bakery goods and dry snacks as well as coatings for card stock, beverage cups, and films. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\">Biopolymer Trading Stock Experiencing a Boom?</span></span></span></h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">Increasing awareness about ecological problems and subsequently a rising demand for eco-friendly packaging is compelling plastic packaging vendors and manufacturers to shift their interest towards biopolymer packaging. Biochemical companies are increasingly gaining market shares with the shifting preference of customers towards more sustainable materials. This has also encouraged several investors to invest in biopolymer trading stock. For instance, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in April 2018, the Raleigh, North Carolina-based biopolymer start-up namely, Tethis IP Holding Co. raised $3.6 million in funding from 76 investors. However, such investors who contemplate of getting involved in the investment of biopolymers require being at the private level.

A lot is at stake for the Argentine team and their fans are definitely rooting for their favorite team. After their last match ended in a draw against Iceland, it is to be seen whether they can bounce back and penetrate the Croatian defense. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">The last match clearly demonstrated the team&rsquo;s over-dependence on their star player Messi. We are yet to see the Messi Magic in the FIFA World Cup 2018, but Argentine fans will definitely be hoping for the best in today&rsquo;s match. However, Messi is certainly under a lot of pressure and looks tired and exhausted. This isn&rsquo;t a good sign for the Argentine team if they hope to win against Croatia. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">A major weakness of the current Argentina team is their lack of star players. There is no one with the same flair as Messi. Moreover, in the last </span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">match</span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">, they depended on only one striker to penetrate the Iceland defense. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Croatia, on the other hand, looks much more in sync and is functioning like a well-oiled machine. They have a very strong mid-field segment that can be a major determining factor. </span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Superstars</span></span></span><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"> from major European clubs such as Barcelona, Real Madrid, </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">and</span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"> Inter Milan are gelling up well in the Croatian midfield. Their striker, Mario Mandzukic, who currently plays for the Italian club Juventus is also looking to be in ominous form and can put Argentina defense to test. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">The only weakness of the Croatian team is their line of defense. The last match did not put much pressure on their defense and the integrity is yet to be tested.

The odds will be further strengthened in favor of Croatia if Pjaca gets more time on the field. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">However, if Argentina decides to give Dybala and Higuain more time on the field and changes their starting lineup, there is a chance that Argentina might register a win against Croatia today by 2 &ndash; 1. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">We will certainly hope for the Messi Magic on the field.

The much-celebrated football team is facing the probability of being eliminated in the first round of the FIFA World Cup 2018 today itself. So, how are the odds staked for tonight&rsquo;s match? Who is the favorite in the stand-off between Argentina and Nigeria? Let&rsquo;s find out the details. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Argentina will have to play exceptionally well and win with a good margin if they are to retain their chances in the run for this year&rsquo;s cup. Moreover, in another match, if Iceland defeats Croatia with a higher margin then Argentina will go down the table despite winning the match. Thus, win margin is going to be critical for the Argentine team. As always, the key player for Argentina remains Lionel Messi. Though this over-dependency seems to be the Achilles heel for the Argentine football team. Higuain, who is yet to play up to his repute, will certainly wish to set the records straight in tonight&rsquo;s match against Nigeria. Whether or not that will happen remains a question. And, the wait for Messi Magic to mesmerize the crowd also seems to be a never-ending one. Die-hard fans will certainly wish for these two star-players to set the field on fire. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Nigeria, though quite low in the FIFA ranking, remains a formidable opponent. Ahmed Musa and Victor Moses will be their key player for tonight&rsquo;s match. A win in tonight&rsquo;s match will also help them secure their spot in the next round. So, quite understandably, the team is going to be all charged up. However, considering the recent performances, the odds seem to be against them. The fact that they are not having any major injury and that there is no extra pressure of expectations from them certainly make things a little easier from Nigeria&rsquo;s perspective. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Weighing all the factors, we have reached our final conclusion.

The knockout stages of the tournament are underway and the teams simply cannot afford to lose even one match if they wish to progress in the tournament. Today&rsquo;s match between Portugal and Uruguay, thus, is going to be quite an exciting affair. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Uruguay is only the second team to have qualified to the knockout stage having won all the group stage matches. While this is an impressive statistic, the performance of the team has not been as impressive. The key Uruguay players Suarez and Cavani are yet to shine to their full potentials. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The Uruguay </span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">defense</span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"> has been, on the other hand, very composed with the likes of Atletico Madrid </span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">stars</span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"> Godin and Gimenez forming the heart of the </span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">defense</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">. Uruguay will have to concentrate on honing their offensive part of gameplay. If we see Suarez, Cavani, Rodriguez, or Sanchez shining and taking the ball into the opponent&rsquo;s territory, they can very well win Uruguay a place in the Quarter Final round. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Portugal, on the contrary, is overly dependent on Ronaldo. Ronaldo is currently the second highest scorer of FIFA World Cup 2018 having four goals to his name, but he missed a penalty in the last match and his performance against Iran was far less than impressive. However, he is a player who likes to leave a mark in the important matches and this can be good news for Portugal. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Speaking of the Portugal </span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">defense</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"> and strategy, the team has been found to be employing an extremely defensive strategy.

Between France and Belgium, it is going to be a close affair. Both the teams are highly motivated to reach the finals of the tournament. For France, it will be their third World Cup final after 1998 and 2006 if they can bag today&rsquo;s match.

Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard, and Dries Mertens will try to break through the French defence and can potentially cause trouble for them. However, the French team also has quite the firepower in the form of Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappe, and Blaise Matuidi. Paul Pogba, who is yet to score or assist in any goal in this World Cup but he can very well emerge as the dark horse in today&rsquo;s clash. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Considering all the factors, here is our prediction for today&rsquo;s semi-final. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"France vs Belgium FIFA World Cup 2018 semi-final result prediction infographics\" src=\"https://sheeranalyticsandinsights.com/public/bimages/img33(2).jpg\" style=\"height:495px; width:880px\" /></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">This game is going to be extremely close and both the teams will certainly score.

Both the teams look well prepared for the clash. The English side looks forward to winning the trophy after a long time since 1966; while, the Croatians will try to make it to the finals of the World Cup for the very first time.

Having scored 6 goals in the tournament already, he is expected to change the course of the game today as well. The place of worry for the Three Lions will be their injured member Jamie Vardy who sustained a groin injury in the game against Columbia and is not sure of making it to today&rsquo;s match. Jordan Henderson also suffered due to a tight hamstring but is expected to be in the starting line-up nevertheless. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Croatia, on the other hand, is a team that has already surpassed all expectations and is probably the more relaxed side in today&rsquo;s match.

The English side certainly falls short in this sector with nobody reached semifinals apart from Henderson. The game will be won in the mid-field with Croatia having the most experienced mid-field in the world cup, with Kovacic, Rakitic, and Modric leading from the front. They will also use Mandzukic&rsquo;s experience in front of the goal. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The Croatians will not be able to play Sime Vrsaljko due to the injury sustained during the match against Russia.

Croatian&rsquo;s have already shown their mettle in sustaining long 120-minute matches and winning the game in the penalties. While this also means that the side is probably tired, but they are fired up no doubt! The England team is yet to face such a difficult challenge. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Taking everything into consideration, here is the prediction for today&rsquo;s match.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"England vs Croatia FIFA World Cup 2018 semi-final result prediction infographics\" src=\"https://sheeranalyticsandinsights.com/public/bimages/img34(2).jpg\" style=\"height:495px; width:880px\" /></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">We keep Croatia ahead of England and predict a Croatian 1-goal win over the English side to proceed to the final.

A month of hopes and expectations, triumphs and setbacks, miracles and upsets, analysis and predictions, everything boils down to this day, as the European nations come together to celebrate the game of football for one last time in this tournament. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Surpassing all expectations and upsetting all calculations, not once, but time and again, the Croatians are in the final of the World Cup for the very first time since they first started playing in the tournament. The Les Blues will be playing in the World Cup final for the third time, the previous two times being 1998 and 2006, with their first attempt being their only successful one.

This world cup has established that fact more than once. However, even though we fill our hearts with hope, the numbers provide some amount of certainty and assurance. Hence, we search for the odds and who has the upper hand in terms of statistics. We check out past records and predictions, trying to find the logic that supports our emotions. Thus, today, as we begin our analysis of the match between France and Croatia, to be played in Luzhniki Stadium on 15<sup>th</sup> July 2018, Sunday, we will set aside our emotions for the moment and check out the raw data and what that predicts about the outcome of the match. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Here are the facts that might hint towards the ultimate result of this clash: </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">France and Croatia have played each other five times in the past, the first one being in the semi-final of 1998 World Cup, where France won 2 &ndash; 1 en route to winning the tournament on home turf. The next two meets were in friendlies played in 1999 and 2000, both won by the Les Blues 3 &ndash; 0 and 2 &ndash; 0 respectively. The last two, though, ended in a draw, with the first of the two being in Euro 2004 (2 &ndash; 2), and the second in 2011 (0 &ndash; 0). </span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">France proceeded to the final by beating Belgium 1 &ndash; 0 with Samuel Umtiti scoring the lone goal in the match and the French </span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">defense</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"> holding up against the Belgian attack. The Croatians, during the other semi-final, made a fantastic comeback after trailing by one goal in the first half by scoring a splendid equalizer during the second-half and finally netting the winning goal during the extra-time of play. While both the teams showed excellent gameplay, France won convincingly within the 90 minutes span since the beginning of the knockout rounds while Croatia took it to the extra time, and even to the penalty shootout, in their knockout matches. Logically, the French are much more rested and seem more organized as compared to the Croatians. </span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The France team is young and free from any injury or suspension. They are going into the final with their entire firepower intact. Croatia, on the other hand, might not have any suspended players, but their team is certainly more stressed out due to the long games they have been playing. Moreover, Ivan Strinic, who pulled out during the extra-time of the play during the semi-final due to some groin injury, remains doubtful for the final. </span></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Unlike our previous predictions, we will only provide you with the odds for each team. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"France vs Croatia FIFA World Cup 2018 final winner odds prediction infographics\" src=\"https://sheeranalyticsandinsights.com/public/bimages/img35.jpg\" style=\"height:495px; width:880px\" /></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">But, as already mentioned, logic can go to a certain extent.

From being the mere display of sporting abilities, the game has been turned into complete entertainment package. From on-field drama, sports, to pre-game and end-game events, entertainment is the buzzword. And, now we have even more technology than ever before that elevates the viewer experience further. But, that&rsquo;s like simply scratching the tip of the iceberg. The true transformation comes with an enhanced live viewing of any sports event and stadiums form an integral part of that experience. Thus, we come across the concept of Smart Stadiums! </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The sports industry today is trying to meet every needs and demand of every single spectator who will be visiting the arena to watch their </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">favorite</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"> match. Digitalization and smart technology are playing major roles in aiding that effort. The live experience of the fans is being refined with the concept of the next-gen venues, thus making way for &lsquo;Smart stadiums&rsquo;.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">It&rsquo;s not merely about the on-field and within stadium experience, the industry is taking a holistic approach towards improving the experience of the crowd through smarter and easier seat booking system, providing a wealth of information on bathroom breaks, seat upgrades, parking upgrade, and many more. What&rsquo;s more, these </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">arenas</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"> have the answer to every type of architectural and technological possibilities. This means that one stadium can now be used for multiple events and the entire architecture can be changed within a matter of hours at most. Also, inside the stadium, the ebb and flow of every human being are tracked every minute with the help of sensors using IoT technologies. The staffs over there can receive every update regarding what&rsquo;s happening in the venue, which increases their efficiency and the capability to maintain top-level security inside the premises.

Smart Stadiums are aiding revenue generation by making the process of purchase of tickets, foods, and merchandise easier, faster, and more personalized. It has become quite like online shopping. There are websites today, through which smart stadiums are making the experience of the fans more personalized through their loyalty programs which will reward them for their previous purchases or it can also suggest new items which will be based on their history of purchase. All this is done with the help of data analytics software which will allow the operators of the stadiums to gain more knowledge about their patrons.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">To lower the cost of their maintenance, the staffs can also monitor the health of everything starting from deep fryers to toilets and can notice when any equipment is starting to show signs of wearing down. This eventually leads them to work promptly on the matter and replace the equipment so that it doesn&rsquo;t break down at any moment. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Fan experience</strong></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">With various facilities and modern technologies, the fans have also started expecting a high level of digital connectedness, customer service, and convenience.

If a fan signs in with an app that runs on their mobile devices the staff can interact directly with them by providing a personalized experience.

We do hear tales of success when a start-up makes it big in the market and creates its own footprint. It is indeed a matter of great pride for any nation and highly beneficial for the global economy. However, what we often miss out are the stories of innumerable start-ups failing to even break-even. What causes a start-up to fail and how can a start-up succeed? Is there any fixed recipe for success? Are investors with deep pockets the only thing that a start-up needs to flourish? Can a start-up survive without major investors? The questions are plenty. But the answers are not always clear. More often than not, the owners of a start-up ignore some extremely valuable factors resulting in the ultimate failure. Ignoring the necessity of a business consultant is among the most important of them. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\">What are start-up consultants?</span></span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">A start-up consultant is someone who has both experiences and is an expert in advising a company on what to do and how they can execute their plan. Their main motive is to figure out a way by which the company can save money, aggravation, and time. In a start-up, one needs experts who can do their job, and even provide training to others on the work that needs to be done. The business consultants have the capability to review their client&rsquo;s business plan, compare them with the goals their clients have, and then suggest ways in which their client can improve their chances of success. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The start-ups are a business that has gained popularity in these recent years, though they work with huge uncertainty.

The expert people in the business tend to ignore the change that is happening outside their company. This is the reason for which they need a honest and unbiased feedback for themselves which will prove to be beneficial for them and here is where the role of a start-up consultant becomes important. A start-up consultant can provide them with the external outlook and thus help them better understand the shortcomings.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em>Management Advice &ndash;</em></strong> The initial ideas and vision of a start-up company go through excel sheets, PowerPoint, and word document presentations on the computer. Most of the people who run a start-up are young therefore it is expected that they lack the required managing experience or the knowledge to venture in the correct direction owing to their lack of experience. In this situations, the start-up consultants provide them with management advice which is based on their experience in finance, marketing, management, finance, and development. The client is also given every understanding of the situations and gains clarity through their work with an experienced professional, someone who has done this entire process many times. Moreover, even with experienced people heading the start-up, it is important to have professionals taking care of the management. Simply put, it is best to delegate the job to the ones who are best suited for the profile. </span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em>Creating a Road Map &ndash; </em></strong>The key service that is provided by the start-up consultants is strategic planning. The start-up consultants help their clients with statistics, analysis, and strategies.

The start-up consultants are experts in their fields of specialization and they have knowledge and training regarding the newest techniques and tactics to expand the growth of the business.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em>Market Research &ndash;</em></strong> For a business to grow further a start-up consultant will accurately research the market and the segments through which the business can grow.

If you want your brand to be a successful one, then enhance in sponsoring the core values of your business. </span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em>Promoting unproductive brand messages &ndash;</em></strong> If your brand message is weak, then it will fail to attract the attention of your customers. Your brand message must be compelling, strong, meaningful and unique enough to attract the customer&rsquo;s attention.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em>Selling poor quality product and services &ndash;</em></strong> One of the main reasons for the brand&rsquo;s failure is dispatching or providing poor quality products and services. Customers do not expect cheap products and services. This can rapidly diminish the brand value.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em>Poor visuals &ndash;</em></strong> The main thing that would determine the success of your brand is framing a strong and attractive company logo that will always pop up in customer&rsquo;s mind.

If one fails to leverage the benefits of their products in the market, then the market value of the brand would drop automatically. </span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em>Business irrelevancy &ndash;</em></strong> There are several reasons that your brand might become irrelevant to customers.

Which means they are able to begin their business at a smaller scale. Even though these start-ups are getting the initial support from Angel investors, mostly family and friends, yet, not even 10% of them are able to secure fund from venture capitalists and other private equity sources. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The question arises, what is going wrong with this majority of the start-ups, and how are the few start-ups making it through these initial stages and working it out? If you are a start-up owner trying to ride out the initial storm or planning to have your own start-up shortly, this should be of interest. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\"><em>How are the start-ups scripting their success story? </em></span></span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">For any entrepreneurial manager reaching this milestone is a huge success in itself. This proves that the technology that was conceptualized has bloomed into a viable commercial opportunity with target customers interested in the product, and investors ready to invest in the company. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">This is where the next challenge presents itself &ndash; creating a plan as to how to sell the product and create a supportable revenue stream. This is what helps develop further product offerings, repay the investors, build infrastructure, and generate income and create employment. Unfortunately, most tech start-ups get stuck at this point. The ones who are making it past this stage are the ones who are successful in creating a viable Go-To-Market strategy and implement the same. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\"><em>How to create winning Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy for Start-Ups?</em></span></span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Creating a GTM Strategy might not seem like the most difficult of all jobs, but it is no child&rsquo;s play either. Start-ups often fail because they are not expert in every aspect of the business. The ones who are managing a tech-based start-up are more efficient with the technical aspects as compared to the sales and marketing part of the business. Likewise, someone else is an expert in one area and unable to grasp the business in its entirety. Then there is another issue, that the only person who is interested in selling the product is the person who has developed it. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Go-To-Market Strategy sets apart the ones who will succeed from the ones who will perish. So, before you begin, you need to learn to ask the right questions. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Let&rsquo;s see which are the major questions that the management of the companies are asking when it comes to creating sales and marketing strategy. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Should the sales happen by engaging direct sales force, or should it be channeled through others?</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">If the sale is done directly then salesperson should be organized by the industry, company size, market, geography, and other principles? </span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The salesperson which we have, will they require technical support and work in teams?</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Is it possible to get our products into the market through channels such as advertising or social media?</span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">And, the list goes on.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The problem is, these questions are wrong, to begin with. What a start-up need is to understand the perspective of their customers and then approach the market, but these questions focus on the perspective of the start-ups and their technologies. They must understand the needs of their customers and try to solve the problem and then think about how their products will help them to be successful.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Therefore, if you are a part of a start-up which needs to accelerate revenue growth, you can consider this approach and see whether it works or not. You can start by identifying a small number of customers, either companies or the desired customer segment. Then you can place yourself in the position of the customers and think about their issues by talking to them about the challenges they face and their pain points.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Once these steps are been taken, you become ready to experiment with a go-to-market approach and expect that you will continuously refine and change it based on your further insights and experience.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\"><em>Go-To-Market Strategies boosting start-ups </em></span></span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">By now it should be amply clear that the GTM strategy formulation is the basic requirement to ensure that the business remains viable and profitable in the long run. However, it is also true that preparing the right GTM strategy requires a deeper insight into the market, which requires a specific set of knowledge and expertise. This is where <a href=\"https://www.sheeranalyticsandinsights.com/consulting-solutions\" target=\"_blank\">business consultants</a>, such as Sheer Analytics and Insights Pvt.

GTM strategy creation begins with the identification of the unique selling points. It also simultaneously creates the plan to place the brand such that it is aligned with the products/services and the image of the company. Moreover, this needs in-depth knowledge of the market. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">While working with various clients we have often come across situations when entire strategy seems to be falling apart.

Therefore, crude oil prices have a significant impact on the economic growth of any country. High crude oil prices adversely affect the twin deficits of an economy &ndash; the current and fiscal account deficit, which further exerts a spillover impact on the consumption, investment behavior and monetary policy of an economy. While oil-exporting nations benefit from surging oil prices, the oil importing countries face higher crude oil import bills that subsequently affect government finances unfavorably. With no significant discoveries or extractions in recent years, the growing production costs have pushed up the prices of crude oil globally. The recent rise in crude oil prices has drawn attention toward the crucial role played by oil exports and imports in any country. Countries that are affected by a hike in oil prices are usually characterized by high net imports of crude oil per GDP. Conventionally, the non-oil producing emerging nations fall under this category as the developed countries are generally more economical in their oil usage and witness an easing of this adverse effect of a rise in prices. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\"><em>What does the increase in global crude oil price mean for Indian economy?</em></span></span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">India, which is posing a double-digit economic growth by certain measures is at present one of the most coveted countries for crude oil exporters among the top five global oil importers including, the U.S., China, India, Japan, and South Korea. India, being the third largest oil importer in the world is one of the most affected economies because of the surging oil prices in the recent months, as the increasing price results in risking reduced current projection for vigorous economic growth, widening the country&rsquo;s trade deficit and putting more upside pressure on inflation, thereby threatening to exceed the government targets. All this is taking place while the Indian citizens and politicians are about to face a series of upcoming elections in this year as well as the next, with a general election anticipated to be held in 2019 spring. Furthermore, the vast crude oil imports of India results in the spending of huge amounts of foreign exchange. Thus, the rising quantum of import of petroleum products has a substantial impact on the Indian economy, particularly when oil prices are shooting up globally. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Global crude oil prices have been at a steady rise over the past few months. Since 2014, for the first time, the international benchmark for the global oil prices have exceeded the $80/barrel mark in May 2018. The oil prices have witnessed a steep hike in the global market lately, bolstered strongly by a combination of steady demand supply cut by the major oil producers led by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the fears of American sanctions against Iran. High oil prices push up rates for diesel and petrol in the country, pose a serious threat to the government finances, induce inflation and boost public demand for subsidies and fuel tax cuts. This rise in prices could exert a great impact on several segments of the Indian economy, for instance:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Impact on Fiscal Deficit:</span></span></span> India imports approximately 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil every year which comes up to more than 85% of its annual crude oil requirement. Thus, the hike in oil prices could increase the country&rsquo;s expenditure, negatively impacting its fiscal deficit, that is, the difference between the total revenue and expenditure of the government, and, a rise in this deficit impacts the economy as well as its markets adversely.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Impact on Current Account Deficit:</span></span></span><strong> </strong>India&rsquo;s dependence on crude on imports have been on a rise over the past years and this has a huge impact on the current account deficit. CAD essentially indicates the amount India owes in foreign currency and a widening CAD further puts pressure on the Indian currency&rsquo;s value as well on the rest of the economy. A report from SBI suggests India&rsquo;s current account deficit could exceed 2.5% of GDP for the financial year 2018, provided the oil price continues at $80/barrel.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Impact of the Indian Currency:</span></span></span><strong> </strong>The rise in crude oil price clearly impact the Indian currency or Rupee by depreciating it. The Rupee has been depreciating since the onset of 2018 and it hit its lowest against the U.S. dollar in the last 15 months, in May 2018. Currency depreciation has a reverberating effect on the economy as well as the stock market and if oil prices remain this steep, the Rupee is expected to further depreciate by the year-end </span></span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Impact on Sensex and Stock:</span></span></span><strong> </strong>The stock markets in India is facing a lot of pressure with the hike in crude oil process. The Sensex fell by 2.3% between 1<sup>st</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> May 2018 alone. There has also been a sell-off in mid and small cap stocks, with oil prices touching $80/barrel. Further, several Indian companies such as lubricants, airline, refining, tyre and footwear companies are dependent on healthy crude oil prices. Higher input costs adversely affect the profitability of these companies and this could negatively impact stock prices in the near term.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Impact on Inflation:</span></span></span><strong> </strong>Oil is a very important commodity in any economy, required to meet the domestic fuel needs and is a necessary raw material across various industries. Thus, an increase in crude oil price implies an increased cost of goods production. This rise in price would be finally passed on to the end-users, subsequently resulting in inflation. Experts opine that a surge of $10/barrel in oil prices is capable of raising inflation by 0.1%.</span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The net trade oil deficit in India has considerably widened and this can be attributed to high oil prices and a weak rupee. The crude oil import bill of India swelled by a quarter in the FY 2017-2018 from $70 billion in the previous fiscal year as the prices rose steeply, as per the ministry&rsquo;s petroleum planning and analysis cell. The average price of Indian basket crude rose up 19% at $56.4/barrel in FY 2017-18 from $47.6 in 2016-17. Owing to India&rsquo;s heavy reliance on imported crude oil, the impact of surging oil prices has resulted in a substantial increase in the oil import bill for the country. The petroleum and natural gas ministry has estimated that India&rsquo;s crude oil import bill might increase 20% to $105 billion in this financial year from $88 billion in 2017-18, assuming the average crude oil price as $65/barrel for the year.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Copyright &copy; 2018 Sheer Analytics and Insights</strong></span></span></p>","image":"/public/bimages/img44.jpg","slug":"impact-of-crude-oil-price-rise-on-india-economy","views":574,"status":1,"created_at":"2018-11-01T01:15:18.000Z"}},{"node":{"id":"mysql__Blogs__45","title":"Parkinson’s Disease Treatment Gets New Smart Tech Boost","meta_title":"Apple Smartwatch Gives Parkinson’s Disease Treatment New Tech Boost","meta_desc":"Parkinson’s disease is a progressive central nervous system disorder that affects the motor systems.

It is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the dopamine-producing neurons in a particular area of the brain, known as the substantia nigra. Generally, the cause of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is unknown, but both environmental, as well as genetic factors, are believed to cause this illness. The risk factors associated with this disease include age, heredity, gender, and exposure to toxins. While Parkinson&rsquo;s itself is not fatal in nature, the disease complications could be very serious. According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ratings, complications from Parkinson&rsquo;s disorder are the 14th cause of death in the United States. An estimated 10 million people suffer from this disease globally and approximately 60,000 people in the States alone are diagnosed with Parkinson&rsquo;s annually. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease are found to generally develop gradually over the years and the progression of these symptoms vary from one individual to the other owing to the diversity of the ailment. In the early stages of Parkinson&rsquo;s, the most obvious symptoms include, difficulty with walking, slowness in movement, changes in speech and gait, shaking, tremors and rigidity. Further, behavioral and thinking problems, including anxiety and depression may also occur in patients. Other apparent symptoms of this disease include emotional, sensory and sleeping problems. In the more advanced stages of Parkinson&rsquo;s, Dementia is known to become common. Medical researchers have also observed that numerous changes occur in the brains of the people affected with Parkinson&rsquo;s such as the presence of Lewy bodies, though the reason behind these changes is unclear. Many of these symptoms are owing to the loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in the brain called dopamine, the decrease of which causes abnormal brain activity, leading to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">There is no standard treatment for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease as the treatment for each individual is based on his or her symptoms. After the diagnosis of this disease, treatments can help relieve symptoms but there is no absolute cure for Parkinson&rsquo;s. The basic treatments include surgical therapy and medication and other treatments are inclusive of lifestyle modifications such as getting more exercise and rest. There are various medications that are available for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s, though none that can yet reverse the effects of this disorder. However, rapid technological advancements in the healthcare sector have resulted in the effective tracking and monitoring of the symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. For instance, in June 2018, Apple Inc. announced that the company has added a new &ldquo;Movement Disorder API&rdquo; to its open source ResearchKit framework which will enable Apple Watch to uninterruptedly monitor the symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s. Apple launched its ResearchKit framework in 2015 to create opportunities for medical researchers to launch iPhone-based studies and use related apps for medical research purposes. The new &ldquo;Movement Disorder API&rdquo; has been developed to offer the app developers using ResearchKit the capability to provide all-day, passive monitoring by means of an Apple Watch running watch OS 5. In order to achieve this, the API would monitor two common symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s that include tremors, indicated by quivering and shaking perceived by the Apple Watch and Dyskinesia, which is a side effect of the Parkinson&rsquo;s treatment causing swaying and fidgeting motions in patients. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Both the researchers in Apple and outside have been focusing on ways to use the ResearchKit software tools for monitoring mobile device users for an array of disorders and diseases. The Apple Watch is swiftly becoming a beneficial tool for medical researchers for tracking down and monitoring the symptoms associated with Parkinson&rsquo;s as well as accelerating research with the &ldquo;Movement Disorder API&rdquo;. The new API makes studies and researches easier since the algorithms have been developed to report back data correlated with a tremor or quiver resulting from the disorder as opposed to any other motion. Commenting on the development of Apple&rsquo;s new API, Julie Dodd, Director of Digital Transformation at Parkinson&#39;s UK, said: &quot;This is one of the promising developments in wearable tech that could revolutionize our understanding of Parkinson&#39;s&rdquo;. Later in 2018, Apple Inc. is in plans of releasing a software update to make it even simpler for the medical researchers to comprehend the difference between random movements and the dyskinesia and tremors experienced by Parkinson&rsquo;s patients while getting treated with medications. Further, as all patients would not have the access or affordability for an Apple Watch, the company has started to collaborate with health insurance companies such as Aetna to find ways of subsidizing the costs.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Sheer Analytics and Insights has a comprehensive report on the <span style=\"color:blue\"><u><a href=\"https://www.sheeranalyticsandinsights.com/market-report-research/global-parkinsons-disease-treatment-market-21\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Global Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Treatment Market</a></u></span>-providing an exhaustive analysis of the global industry, along with offering an in-depth insight into the factors aiding its growth and also the ones posing as restraints to the market growth.

Apart from providing protection to the workers, these types of clothing could also perform the duties of a handy insurance policy for a business at the accident time. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\">Reasons behind using the flame-resistant clothing material </span></span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The primary reason for this type of clothing is to resist ignition because if the flammable clothing by mistake gets ignited by flash fire, arc flash or any kind of molten metal, the risk of the hazard becomes much greater. In this case, the clothing fire would last for a longer period of time and would also burn the victim to a greater extent. The flame-resistant clothing limits the injury burns. Also, the flame-resistant (FR) clothing is hereto insulate the wearer from the fire and thermal hazard, thus eliminating or reducing any kind of second and third degree burns through the apparels, even in the area that is directly impacted by the thermal hazard. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\">The major difference between the arc rated and flame-resistant clothing </span></span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">For encouraging people for specifying and purchasing the fabrics that have been specifically tested for the arc flash hazard, rather than going for purchasing any FR fabric product, the <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=70E\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">NFPA 70E</a> committee created the &ldquo;AR&rdquo; designation. The AR garments have their arc rating displayed in the internal label. The difference between the two lies in the fact that the clothing which has the AR rating is flame resistant (FR), but the truth is not all the FR clothing material has an arc rating. The level of protection of these types of clothing is determined by testing.&nbsp; </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Cambria,serif\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\">Know the growth of the global arc rated and flame-resistant apparels market</span></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Growing safety concerns of the industrial workers in different industrial sectors including oil and gas, chemical and manufacturing industries are projected to drive a greater market growth for the arc rated and flame-resistant apparels during the forecast period.

Nonetheless, arc rating is certainly not a prescient factor in flash fire execution; the test standard for that is <a href=\"https://www.arcwear.com/testing/NFPA-2112.php\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">NFPA 2112</a>. Fabrics pass through this test in the event that they record under half second and third-degree body burn in a 3-second blaze fire (3 seconds since that was the characterized furthest limit of a glimmering fire and under half since survival rates are a lot higher beneath half). The 2112 data is shown as a percent body burn, instead of calories, and in this test the lower the number is, the better the fabric performs. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Once more, all AR fabric is FR, however not all FR fabric have been arc rated.

However, considering the amount of misinformation being shared over the internet, let us first discuss a few facts about the COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span></h3><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How Can COVID-19 Spread?</span></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coronavirus is communicable in nature, which means that it has the ability to spread from an affected individual to another. Even though you will find numerous claims that the virus can spread if you have the meat of any animal that is already infected, the claim is untrue to the best of knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6KUjNhs.jpg\" width=\"912\"><br></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span></h3><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Common Symptoms Of COVID-19</span></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One of the most baffling things about the COVID-19 is its extreme similarity with normal influenza. The initial symptoms are precisely the same – fever, cough, and sore throat. These are quite common in the case of regular influenza. However, within a span of 10 days, these symptoms aggravate, and there are more symptoms such as breathing problems, diarrhea, sputum secretion, body ache, and vomiting. It is, thus, advisable for people facing such symptoms to get themselves checked at the earliest.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Impact On Sports&nbsp;</span></h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now that you are updated about the virus and its spread, it should be amply clear as to why the various organizations across the globe are taking such strict measures. However, the year 2020 was promised to be quite an action-filled in terms of sporting events. But, the Corona Virus scare is quite likely to impact these events negatively in terms of audience turnup. We have already witnessed a few major games being played without any spectator. The same can happen with the upcoming sporting events, namely, the ICC World T20, Copa America, Grand Slams, NBA, Sumer Olympics, and such others. We already have confirmation about the Euro 2020, World Athletics Indoor Championship, and IPL 2020 being postponed. Even with the virus being brought under control in the days to come, there is no guarantee that the fans will risk going to the stadium just immediately. Thus, there seems to be a gloomy future for the sports industry.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Is This An Opportunity For Live VR?&nbsp;</span></h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Come to think of it, almost every negative situation has something positive hidden. And, this might be what the Live VR industry has been waiting for. Live VR, or Live Virtual Reality, has been available for quite some time now. However, adoption has been not that high. But, the COVID-19 scare might just about change that. Major sporting event managers were already considering launching the option of enjoying the sports with the help of Live VR. The best part about this is that the audience will have a virtual experience of watching a live match without having to travel to the venue. This will undoubtedly be an excellent option for many sports enthusiasts across the globe. But the cost has been a somewhat detrimental factor until now. The adoption has been slow, though steady in many parts. However, there is probably nothing better than the risk of falling sick with something potentially life-taking when it comes to giving that final push.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Live VR Shield Against Viral Exposure&nbsp;</span></h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before we delve further, let’s check out the major benefits that Live VR gives.&nbsp;</span></p><ul style=\"color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;\"><li style=\"text-align: justify; background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Entertainment at the convenience of home! It is an undeniable advantage that the Live VR has, and it has been one of the top USPs when it came to marketing the technology. Just imagine that you are experiencing the electrifying environment of sitting in the best seat of the stadium, while watching your favorite sports stars play, all the while enjoying the comfort of your recliner and gorging on some homemade delicacies! Sounds too good to be true, isn’t it? Well, the Live VR set promises just that and delivers on the promise.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=\"text-align: justify; background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Safety guaranteed from any viral exposure. Now, unless you have someone within your home who has contracted the COVID-19, you are safe from getting it while watching the match. The Live VR set will allow you to enjoy all the action, as if you are at the stadium yourself, without you ever coming in close contact with strangers. That certainly sounds like the solution we all need at this time.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=\"text-align: justify; background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; list-style-type: disc;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With stadiums being vacated, the viewers need not worry about going back to the mundane TV sets. The sporting events will be able to gather a much higher number of eyeballs, and thus subscribers, thanks to the Live VRs.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background: transparent; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is undeniable that the Live VR seems like the perfect solution in the sporting season to enjoy sports while staying safe and indoors. So, as gloomy as it might be for many other industries, the viral outbreak might turn out to be a blessing in disguise for the virtual reality industry that has been striving for a long time now to create a lasting impact. But, let’s not forget about quite a few other sectors that are enjoying good business as well. However, we will cover them in detail in our next blog.&nbsp;</span></p>","image":"/public/bimages/img50.jpg","slug":"covid-19-spread-boon-for-live-vr-market","views":460,"status":1,"created_at":"2020-03-19T07:27:22.000Z"}}]}}}
