And, once the patent on Favipiravir expired, there has been a spike in the number of pharmaceutical organizations trying out the drub and other derivatives of it to look for answers. Recently Russia approved Avifavir, a derivative of Favipiravir, for the treatment of COVID-19. Now, India is following suit. The Government of India is looking towards approval of Favipiravir so as to make the antiviral drug available in the market for treatment of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:17px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:#365F91;font-weight:normal;'>What Is Favipiravir?&nbsp;</h2> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that was first developed by Japan&rsquo;s Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Ltd. For the treatment of flu. This anti-influenza medication prevents the further replication of the viral strain within the patient&rsquo;s body and thus helps with the treatment. Ever since the patent expired, the world is looking towards using the drug or its derivatives to see how effective it is against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:17px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:#365F91;font-weight:normal;'>Russia Shows Promise With Avifavir</h2> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>Favipiravir, the generic version of Avifavir, already is a known drug against the treatment of influenza. Russia recently approved the use of Avifavir on patients that tested COVID-19 positive, and, as per reports till now, there is some hope. Russia saw a reduced recovery time among 60% of the patients suffering from COVID-19 after the use of Avifavir. This has been one of the rare good news at a time when the world is grasping at straws while trying to find a treatment for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:17px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:#365F91;font-weight:normal;'>Remdesivir Story In India</h2> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) earlier approved the use of Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in India. However, this is reserved for restricted emergency treatment only at the moment. The treatment is 5 days long and only experienced medical practitioners are allowed to administer the approved dosage of the drug. Hence, at the moment, India is dabbling in one drug, and looking ahead towards another one, as the potential treatment for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:17px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:#365F91;font-weight:normal;'>Glenmark Conducts Trials With Favipiravir</h2> <img src=\"/newsimages/pathologists.jpg\" alt=\"pathologists sheer analytics and insights\" /> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>At the same time when India is considering granting expedited approval for Favipiravir, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is continuing stage three trial of the drug in the country. The pharmaceutical giant seems quite positive about the benefits of using the drug on COVID-19 patients and expects DCGI approval to be available soon.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:17px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:#365F91;font-weight:normal;'>DCGI Awaits Concrete Evidence</h2> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>As per sources within the Government, DCGI is waiting for some concrete evidence about the benefits of Favipiravir before giving it a nod of approval in India. From what can be seen in Russia, that nod is going to come sooner than later. Once the approval is provided, it will be interesting to see how the anti-flu drug, repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19, fairs in India.&nbsp;</p> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>It must be mentioned, that as per data from the scientific world, the COVID-19 viral strain has been mutating quite often. The multiple strains of the virus are making it particularly difficult for the researchers to create one drug to treat every patient, and medical practitioners are relying on symptomatic treatment as of now without having any means of checking the growth of the virus.&nbsp;</p> <h3 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:#243F60;font-weight:normal;'><strong><em>Update: Glenmark Receives Approval Of DCGI For Favipiravir&nbsp;</em></strong></h3> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>Glenmark Pharmaceuticals finally received the approval of Drug Controller General Of India (DCGI) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The approval was provided on an emergency basis keeping in view the growing cases of COVID-19 across India. However, the drug has been approved for &ldquo;restricted emergency use only&rdquo;. This means that the patients will have to sign a consent form before they are administered the drug. As per Glenmark, Favipiravir will be used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 infections only.&nbsp;</p> <h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:17px;font-family:\"Cambria\",serif;color:#365F91;font-weight:normal;'>Favipiravir Cost In India</h2> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>Glenmark is marketing the Favipiravir drug under the name FaviFlu in India for the treatment of COVID-19. Each tablet is being sold at Rs.103 at present. After approval from DCGI, two other pharmaceutical companies, namely Cipla and Strides, are expected to come out with their own Favipiravir drugs soon in India. This is expected to bring down the cost of the drug in the market.&nbsp;</p> <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>With India&rsquo;s number of COVID-19 cases on a sharp rise, and the death toll also going up, people are waiting eagerly for some good news.

No knows for sure whether or not hydroxychloroquine\nactually works, but there are those who believe in the positive effects the\ndrug has on patients diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. But, quite naturally,\nthere are those who have strong reservations against using hydroxychloroquine\nfor the treatment of COVID-19 patients. And, that brings us to the great divide\nthat the world’s facing today!&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Hydroxychloroquine Story&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></b></h2><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">Hydroxychloroquine\nis predominantly used for the treatment of arthritis and malaria. However, lack\nof any vaccination or medication against COVID-19 led to doctors and\nresearchers across the globe try alternate medications that are licensed for\nhuman use. It was then that a group of scientists started using\nhydroxychloroquine as an alternate medication on a test basis. However, the\nsocial media was quick to catch up to this, and there were messages circulating\nabout possible treatment for COVID-19 in the form of hydroxyl chloroquine. This\nled to an increased demand for the drug across various countries. To add fuel\nto the fire, prominent personalities, such as Donald Trump, the President of\nthe United States of America, endorsed the use of the drub publicly during a\npress conference.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">Despite\nthe serious side effects, the use of hydroxychloroquine as an intermediate\nsolution started becoming quite popular.

However, there remain risks, and it was not long before some\nindependent agencies started to point out the flaws.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Lancet Study&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></b></h2><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">The Lancet\nstudy, which recently got published, created a deeper rift in this debate,\nclearly demarcating the ones who are in support of the use of the drug from the\nones who are not. The study shook the scientific world since it clearly claims\nthat the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, both with or without a\ncombination of second-generation macrolide, shows no positive impact in the\ntreatment of COVID-19. The safety and benefits of the use of the medicines for\nthe treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated extremely poorly.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Methodology Of The Lancet Study<o:p></o:p></span></b></h3><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">The Lancet\nstudy methodology is explicitly explained on the website, where the detailed\nreport has been published. As per the report, this was a multinational registry\nanalysis on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, both with and\nwithout a macrolide for the treatment of COVID-19. This study was conducted on\nthe data collected from 671 hospitals spread across six continents between\nDecember 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">The\npatients were distributed in the four groups as per the treatment they received\n– chloroquine only, chloroquine with macrolide, hydroxychloroquine only, and\nhydroxychloroquine with a macrolide. The control group was formed of the ones\nwho did not receive any such treatment. The study excluded the patients for\nwhom the treatment was initiated more than 48 hours of a positive diagnosis of\nCOVID-19, or while the patients were already on a mechanical ventilator.\nMoreover, the patients who received remedesivir were excluded from the\nstudy.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">The\nobjective of the study was to log the outcomes of the treatment in the form of\nin-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias,\nwhich includes both non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia or\nventricular fibrillation.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Findings Of The Lancet Study<o:p></o:p></span></b></h3><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">The total\nnumber of patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study timeframe who met\nthe inclusion criteria is 96,032. The mean age of the study group is 53.8\nyears, and the group consists of 46.3% women. The total number of patients who\nreceived the treatment of interest is 14,888. Out of the total count, 1,868\npatients received chloroquine, 3,783 patients received chloroquine with a\nmacrolide, 3,016 patients received hydroxychloroquine, and 6,221 patients\nreceived hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide. The control group consisted of\n81,144 patients.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">As per\ndata received, 10,698 patients died in hospitals, which is 11.1% of the total number.\nAfter taking into consideration multiple confounding factors, such as, age,\nsex, ethnicity or race, BMI (body-mass index), smoking, underlying lung\ndiseases, diabetes, underlying cardiovascular diseases and the associated risk\nfactors, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity, the\nmortality rate of the various treatment groups is compared with the control\ngroup. The mortality rate of the control group was calculated at 9.3%. Compared\nto that, the mortality rate for hydroxychloroquine alone was at 18%, having a\nhazard ratio of 1.335, whereas, when used with a macrolide, the mortality rate\nstood at 23.8%, and hazard ratio stood at 1.447. For chloroquine, the figures\nfor mortality rate and hazard ratio were found to be 16.4% and 1.365, respectively,\nwhile using a macrolide changed them to 22.2% and 1.368, respectively. This\nclearly showed that the in-hospital mortality rate increased with the use of\nthe drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">The\nresearch also included checking the risk of occurrence of de-novo ventricular\narrhythmia during hospitalization. When compared with the control group, that\nshowed mortality rate due to the de-novo arrhythmia during hospitalization to\nbe at 0.3%, the mortality rate and hazard ratio for hydroxychloroquine only\nwere calculated at 6.1% and 2.369 respectively, while, when the treatment\nincluded the use of a macrolide, the same were at 8.1% and 5.106 respectively.\nFor chloroquine treatment, the mortality rate associated with an increased risk\nof de-novo ventricular arrhythmia was calculated at 4.3%, and the hazard ratio\nwas at 3.561, whereas, the use of a macrolide shifted the figures to 6.5% and\n4.011 respectively.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Conclusion By The Lancet<o:p></o:p></span></b></h3><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">The\nLancet, based upon its findings, clearly objected to the use of either\nchloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, both, with and without a macrolide, for the\ntreatment of the COVID0-19 patients. The findings suggested that there is no\ndirect benefit associated with the use of drugs. Whereas, as feared, the\nadministration of the drugs was increasing the risk of the associated\nside-effects in cases where the drug is not needed in general by the patient.\nMoreover, the mortality rate showed a sharp rise as well, as compared to the\ncontrol group.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Lancet Under Review<o:p></o:p></span></b></h2><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">Ever since\nthe study was published by Lancet, there has been quite a buzz across the\nworld. World Health Organization (WHO) put a stop to all clinical trials of HCQ\non COVID-19 patients. However, the study published by The Lancet came under\nscrutiny due to the alleged discrepancy in the data published within the study.\nFor starters, many peer reviewers pointed out the extremely short duration that\nwas taken to study such a massive amount of data. To conclude conclusively,\nafter in-depth research of such huge data within the timespan mentioned is not\ncommon and can easily cause mistakes. Moreover, the refusal of the author to\nprovide details of the source of the data further put questions on the\nauthenticity of the data mentioned in the review.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">Furthermore,\nan independent investigation by The Guardian showed plenty of discrepancies,\none of them being the data from Australia. While the Lancet review mentioned\nthat there had been 73 deaths out of the 600 COVID-19 patients admitted in\nAustralia as of April 21, 2020, the data with the Johns Hopkins University, US,\nstated that Australia recorded 63 deaths as of April 23, 2020.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">In\nresponse to these allegations, The Lancet researchers clarified that there had\nbeen some errors in the classification of some hospitals that led to the\nhospitals from Asia to be classified under Australia, resulting in the data\ndiscrepancy. However, The Lancer stood firm when the integrity of the study was\nbrought under question.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Implications Of The Study<o:p></o:p></span></b></h2><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">It can be\nquite convincingly said that there were indeed few valid discrepancies in the\nstudy published by The Lancet, as already confirmed by the medical journal.\nHowever, this cannot put the entire study and its findings into question. There\nis still no clear evidence about the benefit of the use of hydroxychloroquine\nwhen administered to COVID-19 patients. However, this study has certainly put\nthe trials on pause across the world. Many major countries, such as France,\nItaly, Egypt, Tunisia, Columbia, Chile, El Salvador, Cape Verde, Albania, and\nBosnia and Herzegovina, stopped the trials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">Having\nsaid so, there are countries that still put their faith in the drugs, namely,\nBrazil, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Jordan, Romania, Portugal, Kenya, Senegal,\nChad and the Republic of Congo.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;line-height:115%\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:\n0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:115%\"><span style=\"color:#0E101A\">This\nreport certainly creates a negative impact on the mentality of volunteers for\nthe study. It is expected that the report being published will demotivate\nvolunteers from participating in such studies. However, clinical trials are\ncontinuing in many countries, and at a time when there is no known drug for\nCOVID-19, it can be said with certainty that these trials will continue till\nsome concrete evidence comes to light.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>","image":"/public/newsimages/img34.jpg","slug":"hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-lancet-study","views":18,"status":1,"created_at":"2020-06-06T16:33:21.000Z"}},{"node":{"id":"mysql__News__33","news_cat":"1","title":"Analytical Democracy– A Predictive Analysis Based Psephology Report On General Election 2019","alt_text":"Analytical Democracy– A Predictive Analysis Based Psephology Report On General Election 2019","meta_title":"Analytical Democracy– A Predictive Analysis Based Psephology Report On General Election 2019","meta_desc":null,"meta_keywords":null,"body":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;\nline-height:107%;font-family:\" arial\",sans-serif\"=\"\">The Indian general election\n2019 is just around the corner and its time for the political endgame! <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;\nline-height:107%;font-family:\" arial\",sans-serif\"=\"\">As every political party gears\nup to gain the public approval, we at Sheer Analytics and Insights Pvt.

At the Game Developer Conference (GDC), at its annual keynote address,\r\nthe company offered the first look of the exclusive Activision’s Call of Duty\r\nMobile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><i><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:\r\n115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Call of Duty and its comparison with PUBG<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;\r\nline-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">The Call of Duty is being\r\ncompared to the shooter games. In fact, it is being compared with PUBG and its\r\ngaming aspects. Most recently, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was\r\nreleased in October 2018, has brought in several elements from PUBG itself.\r\nSimilar to PUBG, the Call of Duty also has the blackout mode which brings the\r\nbattle royal gameplay which has the end motive is to be last standing person on\r\nthe game.

However, constant innovation seems to be the key to retain\r\nthe position in the market, and Xiaomi seems to have taken an interest in one\r\nof the past fads – foldable phones; only this time, it will be foldable\r\nSmartphones. Ending much anticipations and wait, Xiaomi finally launched its very\r\nfirst smart foldable phone which has garnered quite the attention of the users.\r\n<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;\r\nline-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">The foldable smartphone from\r\nXiaomi folds over three times and is going to make its launch in India soon.\r\nThe market is expecting the phone to enter the market by the end of April or\r\nelse by the first week of June, this\r\nyear. One of the most surprising fact related to the price of this phone is\r\nthat it even undercuts the cost of the Samsung Galaxy Foldable phone. The phone\r\nhas been priced at 74,999 INR. This is half the price of the Samsung Galaxy\r\nfoldable phone which was sold at a whopping\r\namount of $2000. However, Huawei’s Mate X was priced at $2,600. Although\r\ndifferent foldable smartphones were launched by different industry players,\r\nstill very few remained intact in the market owing to their pricing factor.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has recently revealed in a letter to the investors that the company has been witnessing a weaker demand for iPhones with the consumer upgrade cycles becoming longer. The demand has been lesser in the region of Greater China. Apple also revealed that the economic condition of the country is slowing down gradually and the competition from various local brands like Huawei is increasing. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The holiday sales figure for Apple&rsquo;s Smartphone has been lower than anticipated. One of the primary reasons, as it seems, is that existing customers have been taking significant advantage of the heavily discounted prices for the iPhone battery replacements. Earlier, in December 2017, Apple was accused of gradually slowing down the older iPhone&rsquo;s performance. In response to the public outrage, Apple has cut down the battery replacement price for the out-of-warranty phones from $79 to $29 for a one-year duration. Therefore, anyone with an iPhone 6 and other later versions could get a new battery under $30. This move has influenced the sales of the company adversely.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Cook mentioned that the revised expected revenue for the Apple iPhone sales will be $9 billion lower in the first quarter than the initial estimation. Earlier this year, Apple informed the investors that the sale of the Smartphone during Q1 will be in $89 to $93 billion range. This has now been revised to the value of $84 billion. Following the announcement, the stock of Apple was plunged by 10%. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">However, Tim Cook clarified that all the categories excluding the iPhone, including its Mac, Services, iPad, Home, Wearables, Accessories and others combined are witnessing a CAGR of almost 19%. Apple has been facing challenges across the emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region. Rising competition from local brands that offer superior quality in terms of service but at a fraction of the Apple iPhone cost are gaining customers rapidly. Even One Plus, a premium range considering other Smartphone prices, costs half the price of the latest iPhone, while the quality of the phone is arguably at par with that Apple has to offer in its Smartphone segment. To make matters worse, an uncertain global currency and dollar fluctuations have also contributed to the dipping of the sales. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Few Indian users, after hearing the news, took to their twitter handle this morning saying that they are not ready to upgrade their new iPhones because of their absurd and high prices. However, Apple cannot ignore this issue for long, since iPhone hold the largest share of its company&rsquo;s revenue pie, and a slowdown will cause major and real concern for the tech giant. It is yet to be seen what new strategy Apple devices hereafter to make things better for the brand, which is still considered among the pioneers in technological advancement in the smart devices segment. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Copyright &copy; 2019 Sheer Analytics and Insights</strong></span></span></p>","image":"/public/newsimages/img29.jpg","slug":"apple-iphone-sales-fall-blames-customers","views":null,"status":1,"created_at":"2019-01-07T23:22:50.000Z"}},{"node":{"id":"mysql__News__27","news_cat":"1","title":"Amazon acquires Indian hypermarket chain More for $580 million","alt_text":"Amazon acquires Aditya Birla Group hypermarket More","meta_title":"Amazon acquires Indian hypermarket chain More for $580 million","meta_desc":"The retail giant, Amazon has yet again made the news by its recent purchase of More for $580.35 million.

According to market researchers, the rise of the share was spurred owing to the price cuts by several top brands after the authorities reduce import duties on some of the goods and made it difficult to buy products from the overseas websites and vendors. The prices of the luxury goods in China, that was previously higher than in Europe and the United States, are witnessing a gradual fall. In order to allow firms to cut prices the taxes have also been lowered by 7-17 percent. Sunny Deng, 28, who studies in America but was on holiday in Shanghai said that &ldquo;When I compare it with the United States the price difference between brands is not that large.

Let's know more about it from the excerpt below.","meta_keywords":null,"body":"<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">IKEA has planned to do few things differently after it inaugurates its first store in Hyderabad, India, on Thursday, in order to deal with the higher taxes on various imported goods and to woo the price-conscious shoppers unfamiliar with the DIY furniture assembly style of the company. Currently, the Swedish furniture retailer is pushing into newer countries in Asia and South America as the growth slows down. The business is getting better in India with its rising middle class, likely avoiding a repeat of the high pricing which initially met the sales target in Australia and China.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The company is trying to keep the process of its products low as it has flagged off its import duties in India. It has to source at least 30% of its raw material within five years of its running locally in the country as per as the Indian regulation. IKEA sources almost fifth of its global supplies right from India. The 400,000 square feet store in Hyderabad would offer the customers with 1,000 products which include stuffed toys, cutlery, container boxes and hangers all priced under 200 INR ($2.91) that is cheaper than in most of the countries.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If one check on the new website of IKEA India showcased all the popular products that looked way cheaper than in the US. For example, the best-selling Billy bookcase in India is cheaper by a fifth than in the US. It clearly seems that IKEA has cracked the Indian consumer mindset and priced its products accordingly. At the moment, the target audience for several IKEA products is going to be the wealthier middle class.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">For satisfying the Indian fondness for the ready-made furniture, IKEA has set up a task force of 150 members for helping the customers in assembling the furniture. It is currently partnering up with UrbanClap which is an application for connecting people with various services providers including beauticians, carpenters, and others. The UrbanClap charges the customers near about 250 INR ($3.64) for a half an hour carpentry job unlike TaskRabbit, which charges the US shoppers with a minimum fee of $36 for any kind of installation services.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">IKEA has currently planned to pen near about 25 stores all over the nation by the year 2025. It is also planning to open stores at the smaller mall stores for complementing their typically larger showrooms in the suburbs. Meanwhile, the IKEA is getting a tough competition from other online furniture selling startups like UrbanLadder and Pepperfry in the metro cities. It has thus been analyzed that the overall furniture market is dominated by several local and retail vendors.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The company has recently bought land in Indian cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Gurugram, and Bangalore.

Here, more than 28 million developers share, collaborate and learn to create new-age technologies together. The acquisition will result in the two companies empowering the developers and pushing them towards better achievement at every stage of the development cycle, encourage adoption of GitHub by major enterprises, and employ Microsoft developer&rsquo;s services and tools to benefit developers from all spheres. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft said that Microsoft is the first developer company and by joining hands with the GitHub, it aims to strengthen the commitment to the developer&rsquo;s openness, innovation, and freedom.

Subjected to various customary closing conditions, the acquisition is mostly expected to close by the end of this calendar year. GitHub will continue to operate independently and retain its developer first ethos by providing an open platform for the developers in all the industries. The developers will continue to use the programming tools, languages and operating systems of the project of their choice. The developers will now be able to deploy their operating system code to any cloud, operating system, or any other device. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Corporate Vice President of Microsoft, Nat Friedman, who is also the founder of Xamarin will now assume the role of GitHub CEO. The current CEO of GitHub, Chris Wanstrath will become the technical fellow of Microsoft. Wanstrath also said that he is extremely proud of the accomplishments of the GitHub community over the past decade. He cannot just hold his excitement to see what lies ahead. He further added that he sees a bright future in software development and is very much thrilled to join hands with Microsoft. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Today, most of the companies are transforming themselves into a software company. These companies are right at the center of the digital transformation. They are driving the business functions and processes across various organizations from HR and customer service to IT and marketing. The choices that these developers will make would increasingly determine the growth and value creation across all the industries. GitHub is now the perfect home for millions of modern developers and is also one of the popular destinations for software innovation and open source projects. The platform even holds a host of growing network of developers from almost every country, representing 1.5 million companies, and above which includes sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, retail, technology and more. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Once the deal closes, Microsoft mainly expects that GitHub&rsquo;s financials will be reported as a part of the Intelligent Cloud segment. It also expects that this acquisition will be accretive to the operating income in the fiscal year 2020 on the non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP excludes the expected impact on the purchase accounting adjustments as well as all the transaction related and integration related expenses. An incremental share buyback is expected to offset the stock consideration that paid within the six months of closing. Microsoft is planning to use the remaining portion of $30 billion of its present share repurchase authorization for making the purchase. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">&copy; Sheer Analytics and Insights Pvt.

This is meant to ease the rules that were introduced by Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010 in a bid to boost the economy and improve lending. From quite a long time, banks have been complaining about the unfair rule that was having a negative impact on the non-US operations of many banks since it broadly included all financial institutions that deal with the US or have relationships with affiliates that deal with the US. The rewrite seeks to clarify those trades that qualify for safe harbors, such as when the banks enable the client trades by hedging risks and expanding those exemptions. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Charles Horn, a partner at the law firm of Morgan Lewis in Washington said that the proposal that is released on Wednesday mainly contains the various elements which directly benefits the global banks as well as the financial institutions of the US.

Banks with trading assets in between $1 billion and $10 billion would avail the benefit of the simpler rule set, while those banks with less than $1 billion in trading assets would be presumed as compliant. The rule was overseen by the US regulators and the Federal Reserve.

But, while being a boon to the society, on one hand, it has also become a cause of bane for mankind on the other. The growing use of internet has led to the rise of cybercrime on a global scale. On 28th may, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Montreal claimed that the data of almost 90,000 customers had been stolen by the cyber attackers. On 27th may, the Bank of Montreal; Canada&rsquo;s fourth-largest lender was called up by the cyber attackers who claimed that they were in the possession of all the financial and personal details of the bank&rsquo;s selected customers. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">A spokesperson for the bank believed that out of 8 million customers of the bank, near about 50,000 customers bank accounts were hacked. But the spokesperson is unsure if any of the customers lost money in the cyber attack. He also said that they were threatening to reveal the data of the customers making it a public data. The bank is now under severe turmoil and is conducting a thorough inquiry and investigation on this matter. The officials of the Bank of Montreal believe that the attack was originated from outside the nation. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">After Bank of Montreal came the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada&rsquo;s fifth-largest lender. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was also contacted by the fraudsters on 27<sup>th</sup> May claiming the theft of 40,000 bank customers financial and personal information via electronic medium. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said that its main banking division was not affected by the cyber attack.

The <strong>cyber security market</strong> is growing with the increase in the number of global cybercrimes. Cyber attacks are becoming very common these days as these attackers target the prosperous business organizations like banks and other financial institutions from where they extract a huge amount of money through easy hacking of all the sensitive information.

Now consider the fact that e-commerce is estimated to become as large as $88 billion by the year of 2025. A manager at a construction material supplier in Vietnam, Phuong, 36, on being confronted mentioned: &ldquo;I have never tried using mobile payments because I don&rsquo;t know how to use it and it seems a bit complicated to use.&rdquo;&nbsp; In China the use of mobile payment is ubiquitous, there are some beggars over there who accept mobile payments, but in Southeast Asia cash is still the king.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\">Why is going cashless a better policy?</span></span></span></h1>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The market of mobile payment in Southeast Asia is wide open as there are no dominant players in the market. According to the citizens over there, the biggest challenge for them while adopting the cashless method is that cash remains easy to use and inexpensive. Now, there are many companies who are ready to fill the unoccupied place in the Southeast Asian market such as Singapore-based Grab&rsquo;s GrabPay, Indonesia&rsquo;s ride-hailing Go-Jek&rsquo;s Go-Pay, and even the gaming company Razer Inc. Mobile payment addresses many problems which the cash on delivery cannot, such as if a customer does not have sufficient cash or is not at home, then the product has to be sent back which increases the logistic cost. Over here, the mobile payment benefits the purchaser and the sellers as the buyer has to give the exact amount and the logistic cost also does not increase as it will be delivered as per the time is given by the buyer.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"color:#365f91\">Going slow is the best policy</span></span></span></h2>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">It is actually difficult to pursue the users to switch from using cash when their earnings are just about $200 on average a month in regions such as Indonesia and Vietnam. According to the companies such as Grab it has to be a slow process. To disrupt this habit, they are trying to create a more cashless payment in the cases of daily use. These mobile payment companies are estimating that they will be able to transform their platform into financial supermarkets, which will offer everything starting from loans to insurance. Here, the region of Southeast Asia everybody uses a smartphone starting from a scrap collector to a businessman, but they don&rsquo;t want to use cashless payment as the slow internet is also one of the reasons for which they prefer to deal in cash. The Philippines is known to have the slowest internet speed in Asia-Pacific, and connectivity is one of the major obstacles that the digital payment system has to face.

The new law on online data privacy not only regulates the use of private data collected by websites but also makes provision for heavy fines on violation.

Every internet user has, at one point in time or another, bought convenience and entertainment in exchange for their personal information and right to privacy. The grand data bargaining market, however, seems to be having a tough time ahead, at least in the European Union. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"color:#2f5496\"><em>What law EU brought in to play in terms of online privacy protection?</em></span></span></h1>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">In what can be termed as a historical move, the European Union is all set to introduce a brand-new law, termed as</span></span></span> <span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\">General Data Protection Regulation</a>, <span style=\"color:#000000\">on May 25, 2018. From the looks of it, the EU GDPR is going to be the most stringent personal data protection and online privacy-related law in existence. What makes the law even more aggressive is the fact that it comes with a provision to fine any violating company or media organization up to a maximum of &euro;20 Mn or 4% of their global revenue, whichever is higher. To put things into perspective, the fine amount will be to the tune of $1.6 Bn for Facebook if it is found in violation of the law. </span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"color:#2f5496\"><em>How EU GDPR affects global businesses? </em></span></span></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">While it is too early to comment, the EU GDPR is certainly going to make things a lot more difficult for the global businesses. Data market monitoring has been one of the primary means of market analysis and target marketing to prospective customers. While the use of Big Data analysis for data market monitoring has not become illegal, buying user-related data from third-party websites or using user data for various marketing activity using third-party analytics services certainly will come under scrutiny and might be termed illegal under the new law.</span></span><span style=\"font-size:20px\"> <a href=\"https://www.sheeranalyticsandinsights.com/data-market-monitoring\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\">Data market monitoring services</a> <span style=\"color:#000000\">being provided by market research and analysis firms seem to stay legal as of now. </span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"color:#1f3763\"><em>Will your Internet experience change? </em></span></span></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Unless you are residing in the EU this change might not mean anything significant when it comes to your internet experience. For the residents of EU, this will probably mean less number of advertisements following them around right after they check out some product on some store online or read a story about a particular product. However, in the wake of the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal and involvement of Facebook in the matter, it is likely that other Governments across the globe will soon be formulating similar laws to prevent violation of the right to privacy and misuse of personal data collected online. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">The final effectiveness of the law can only be seen once it is implemented. Whatever it might be, this certainly seems like the dawn of new Internet privacy rules and laws. The Internet Big Data game is in for a major change pretty soon. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\">&copy; Sheer Analytics and Insights Pvt.
